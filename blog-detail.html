                        Foreign investment in Vietnam has grown substantially in recent
                        years. This growth began in the 1980s with the Doi Moi reforms and
                        picked up again in 2007 with the country’s entry into the WTO,
                        which reduced trade barriers to entry for foreign investors.
                        Investors have a number of options for entry into the Vietnamese
                        market. Vietnam’s Law on Enterprise and Law on Investment
                        implemented in 2015, define all market entry options. We have
                        outlined the most common forms of market entry for foreign
                        investors, touching on the requirements, time frame for the
                        establishment and best structure suited for each mode of
                        investment. Representative office Representative offices (RO)
                        offer a low-cost entry for companies seeking to gain a better
                        understanding of the Vietnamese market. As such, this option is
                        among the most common for first-time entrants to the Vietnamese
                        market and often precedes a larger presence within the country.
                        Currently, activities permitted for RO extent to: - Conducting
                        market research - Acting as a liaison office for its parent
                        company - Promoting the activities of its head office through
                        meetings, and other activities, that leads to business at later
                        stages. Capital Requirements Vietnam’s Ministry of Planning and
                        Investment (MPI) does not currently specify required capital for
                        representative offices. While the MPI does not impose specified
                        capital requirements, companies will be required to show that
                        their capital contributions are sufficient to fund the activities
                        of their operations. As a result, potential investors should
                        prepare to commit a minimum of US$ 10,000 to fund their
                        operations. Timeframe for Establishment Representative offices can
                        be set up in between six to eight weeks. Given the absence of
                        in-country revenue and associated licensing requirements, the
                        setup process for this option does not entail as many bureaucratic
                        procedures as others. Benefits Representative offices do not face
                        the level of compliance requirements levied upon fully established
                        enterprises by the Ministry of Planning and Investment. Further,
                        companies are not subject to corporate income tax or compliance
                        under a representative office structure. Limitations While
                        permitted to engage in specific activities, such as market
                        research, representative offices are subject to a variety of
                        restrictions that make them less effective for companies with
                        plans to establish an operational presence in the country.
                        Representative offices are not legally independent from their
                        parent company; the parent company is liable for all
                        representative office actions in Vietnam. In addition,
                        representative offices cannot conduct profit generating activities
                        within Vietnam, including, but not limited to: - Execution of
                        contracts; - Receipt of funds; - Sale of goods; - Provision of
                        services.
